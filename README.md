# nps-api-samples
Sample code in a few different languages demonstrating common calls to the NPS API. Though not complete applications, these snippets do show commonly needed functions such as:
* Park address lookup - Demonstrates 'fields' parameter in order to retrieve non-default fields.
* Park lat/long lookup - Simple example returning default fields of 'fullName' and 'latLong'.
* Park names by state - Demonstrates 'stateCode' parameter in order to filter results by state.
* List of all parks - Demonstrates 'limit' parameter in order to return all park names.
